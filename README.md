# cleaning_data

Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset.  
Messy data leads to unreliable outcomes. Cleaning data is an essential part of data analysis, and demonstrating your data cleaning skills is key to landing a job.


##  Key Concepts and Challenges
- **Data Integrity:** Ensure accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data.  
- **Missing Data Handling:** Impute or handle gaps in the dataset.  
- **Duplicate Removal:** Identify and eliminate duplicate records.  
- **Standardization:** Apply consistent formatting and units.  
- **Outlier Detection:** Detect and address outliers that may skew analysis.  

## Learning Objectives
- Gain hands‑on experience in cleaning messy datasets.  
- Learn techniques for handling missing values and duplicates.  
- Improve skills in preparing data for analysis and modeling.  

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`DataCleaning.ipynb`).
